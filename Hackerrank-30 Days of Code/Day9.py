Objective 
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial 
Task 
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer,  as a parameter and prints the result of  ( factorial).

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of .

Input Format

A single integer,  (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints

Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.
Output Format

Print a single integer denoting .

Sample Input

3
Sample Output

6
Explanation

Consider the following steps:

From steps  and , we can say ; then when we apply the value from  to step , we get . Thus, we print  as our answer.
